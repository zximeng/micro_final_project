        <h2 id="Introduction-header"> Introduction</h2>
        <p> For our final project, we built a 2 axis robot arm with a capacitive sensor on the final member, which will
            <br>allow the robot to detect
            <br>a person near the robot. When there is an object detected, the arm will
            <br>stop depending on the measured capacitance. The purpose of this
            <br>type of sensor is to allow robots and humans to work in the environment safely.
            <br>Functionally, this product will allow a user to move around the robot arm with
            <br>potentiometers to complete a task as desired. In addition to that, the user can
            <br>work alongside the robot with the risk of injury mitigated by the capacitance sensor
            <br>on the robot. </p>

        <p>The actual design of the robot is based on using 2 servo motors connected directly
        <br>together via 3d printed parts. Each of the joints is controlled by a PWM signal from the
        <br>PIC32 processor. Each joint will have a corresponding potentiometer that the user can use
        <br>to control the position of the arm. To do this, we used the on-board ADC to determine the 
        <br>current potential of the potentiometer. From there we converted it to a % duty cycle to 
        <br>control the servo motor position.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For the capacitive sensor portion, we used copper foil surrounding the arm (a rod) that will act 
            <br>as a very simple capacitor. We had a function to measure the capacitance of the foil by charging
            <br>it and measuring the voltage through ADC. The CTMU would charge the foil for certain amount 
            <br>of time with pre-set current so we have the charge. Then we can calculate the Capacitance 
            <br>using the formula C = q/v. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Then we low pass and detect the capacitance change, stop the arm where it is and stop reading
            <br>from controls.

        <h4> 3d printed parts</h4>
        <p>Our physical design consists of two servo motors with 180 degrees of rotation connected together
            <br> to make a simple arm with two degrees of freedom. The base motor is mounted with a 3D printed part
            <br>onto a piece of 2x6 wood which serves as a base to keep the arm in place. Connected to the base servo
            <br>is another 3D printed mount which connects to the second servo motor. Finally, a final mount connects
            <br>the second servo to the arm which is simply a piece of carbon fiber tubing. Below is a diagram of the
            robot arm made.</p>
        <p>Each of the pieces that were 3D printed were made using Autodesk Inventor. The design for this was to
            <br>be as simple and effective as possible while using minimal material. The bottom piece has four slots
            <br>for wood screws to mount the piece to the wood base in addition to 2 5mm holes to place threaded heat
            <br>set inserts for M3 screws. Each part made has these slots which allows us to easily attach the pieces
            <br>to the motors and the carbon tube.</p>
        <h3>Hardware Components Overview</h3>
        <h4>Prototyping Board</h4>
        <p>In addition to the robot arm hardware, we also designed a simple soldered prototyping board
            <br>which allows us to easily connect and disconnect the PIC32, motors, and power supply.
            <br>Additionally, it made the control of the robot very clean and consistent without any
            <br>possible loose wires. </p>
