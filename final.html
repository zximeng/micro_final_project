            <h2 id="Introduction-header"> Introduction</h2>
                <p> For our final project, we built a 2 axis robot arm with a capacitive sensor on the final member, which will allow the robot to detect 
                    a person near the robot. When there is an object detected, the arm will 
                    stop depending on the measured capacitance.  The purpose of this 
                    type of sensor is to allow robots and humans to work in the environment safely. 
                    Functionally, this product will allow a user to move around the robot arm with 
                    potentiometers to complete a task as desired. In addition to that, the user can 
                    work alongside the robot with the risk of injury mitigated by the capacitance sensor 
                    on the robot. </p>

         <h4> 3d printed parts</h4>
         <p>Our physical design consists of two servo motors with 180 degrees of rotation connected together
            <br> to make a simple arm with two degrees of freedom. The base motor is mounted with a 3D printed part
             <br>onto a piece of 2x6 wood which serves as a base to keep the arm in place. Connected to the base servo
             <br>is another 3D printed mount which connects to the second servo motor. Finally, a final mount connects
             <br>the second servo to the arm which is simply a piece of carbon fiber tubing. Below is a diagram of the robot arm made.</p>
          <p>Each of the pieces that were 3D printed were made using Autodesk Inventor. The design for this was to
              <br>be as simple and effective as possible while using minimal material.  The bottom piece has four slots
              <br>for wood screws to mount the piece to the wood base in addition to 2 5mm holes to place threaded heat
              <br>set inserts for M3 screws. Each part made has these slots which allows us to easily attach the pieces
              <br>to the motors and the carbon tube.</p>
           <h3>Hardware Components Overview</h3>
           <h4>Prototyping Board</h4>
            <p>In addition to the robot arm hardware, we also designed a simple soldered prototyping board 
                <br>which allows us to easily connect and disconnect the PIC32, motors, and power supply. 
                <br>Additionally, it made the control of the robot very clean and consistent without any 
                <br>possible loose wires. </p>
