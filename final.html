    <h1>Capacitive Sensing Robot Arm</h1>
        <hr>
        <section>
            <h2> Introduction</h2>>
                <p> For our final project, we are proposing to build a 2 or 3 axis robot arm with 
                    a capacitive sensor on the final member, which will allow the robot to detect 
                    a person near the robot. When there is an object detected, the arm will either 
                    stop or slow down depending on the measured capacitance.  The purpose of this 
                    type of sensor is to allow robots and humans to work in the environment safely. 
                    Functionally, this product will allow a user to move around the robot arm with 
                    potentiometers to complete a task as desired. In addition to that, the user can 
                    work alongside the robot with the risk of injury mitigated by the capacitance sensor 
                    on the robot. </p>
